# Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the models contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, among others.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a prevalent health issue globally and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Machine learning models can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease based on their health attributes and historical data.

This project explores the application of various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

## Dependencies
This project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Models
Several machine learning algorithms are explored in this project, including:

- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The models are compared to identify the most suitable algorithm for heart disease prediction.
